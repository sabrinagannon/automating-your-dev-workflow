# Automating Your Dev Workflow

These are materials for a talk given for the June 2022 meetup of Wnrb, a community for women and non binary Ruby devs.

## Talk blurb

This talk introduces tools and techniques for setting up and automating your development workflow.
We'll explore how using tools like templates, snippets, and gems can help us use techniques like TDD more easily.
The content assumes you're writing Ruby code but is otherwise text editor agnostic, with a focus on tips for adapting what we explore to your environment and workflow.
